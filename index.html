          <p>In India, Cricket isn't just a game. It is a bona fide religion.
          A religion where cricketers are Gods and every victory is a
          festival.Indians just need an excuse to celebrate.
          Remember the epic party that followed after we won the
          2011 World Cup?</p></div>

        <h2><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/35320.html">
       Sachin Tendulkar </a></h2>
        <img src="sachin.jpg" alt="Sachin Tendulkar"> <div class="text">
        <p>In a nation of 1.3 billion people with 1.3 billion problems,
        he was and still is a source of pride and joy to us all. I grew up watching him play
        and win so many matches for India. He is the perfect role model for any
        budding sportperson. There is nothing more nostalgic than Harsha Bhogle talking
        about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR9Kw2uSwaU">
        "the first ever 200 runs in ODI cricket" </a>.</p></div>

        Rahul Dravid </a></h2></div>
        <img src="rahul.jpg" alt="Rahul Dravid"> <div class="text">
          <p>Rahul Dravid was probably one of the last classical Test match
          batsmen.His progress into the national side may have been steady and
          methodical rather than meteoric, but once there, Dravid established
          himself at the vanguard of a new, defiant generation that were no
          longer easybeats away from home. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4cNkyba_hQ">
          "Century at Lords" </a> in 2011 is my all time favorite.</p></div>

          AB de Villiers </a> </h2></div>
        <img src="abd.jpg" alt="Ab De Velliers"> <div class="text">
          <p>There is hardly an Indian cricket fan these days who does not love
          AB de Villiers.The Indian fans worship De Villiers to the extent that
          they have even cheered him on during India-South Africa encounters.
          If there is any batsmen who can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6B2da3DPA">
            "smash any bowler" </a> in the world,it's definitely AB de Villiers.</p></div>

        <h2><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/player/43547.html">
          Wassim Akram </a></h2>
        <img src="akram.jpg" alt="Wassim Akram"> <div class="text">
        <p>Wassim Akram is to me the best ever fast bowler the world has ever seen.
        With a short runup and ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkSWASp6mA">
        "swing the ball"</a> both ways, he was a nightmare more most accopmplished
        batsmen in the world.He used to play for Pakistan which was the team that Indians hated
        the most.Inspite of that i still like him for his sheer cricketing abilities.</p></div>

          Anil Kumble </a></h2></div>
        <img src="anil.jpg" alt="Anil Kumble"> <div class="text">
          <p>Anil Kumble is one of the two crickets to have claimed all 10 wickets
          in an innings. He is the highest wicket taker in test cricket for India
          till date. I also have a personal fond memory of having met him in person
          at a function in bangalore. He is gusty player and no one can forget
          how he bowled in West Indies with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pc_oiFozY">
         "broken jaw".</a></p></div>
